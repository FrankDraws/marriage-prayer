            <p>Babe I love you. I'm so happy that I get to be your husband.</p>
            <p>
                FATHER I thank you for this beautiful woman that you gave to me
                as a gift.
            </p>
            <p>
                I pray that you bless her day today and let her experience your
                presence in a real way.
            </p>
            <p>Challenge her to grow.</p>
            <p>And FATHER, teach me to be the man that she needs.</p>
            <p>
                Teach me to reflect your love and your passion for her in a real
                way.
            </p>
            <p>And may I only ever speak over her, what you say about her.</p>
            <p>Thank you FATHER for the honor of getting to be her husband.</p>
